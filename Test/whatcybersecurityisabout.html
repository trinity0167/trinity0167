				<h2>What Cyber Security is about</h2>
				<p> Cyber security is the key to staying safe online. There are many malicous threats that risk your security. Cyber Security is like your digital safe, keeping threats locked outside and your stored items safe.
				    Imagine leaving your computer unlocked and turned on in the middle of a busy area completely open to strangers using it, it wouldnt last long before someone would try and steal valuable information.
					Having no cyber security is like this, there are dangerous people online always looking for ways to break into peoples systems and steal information.</p>
					
				<p> <q>Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting critical systems and sensitive information from digital attacks. Also known as information technology (IT) security, cybersecurity measures are designed to combat threats against networked systems and applications, whether those threats originate from inside or outside of an organization.</q><br>(IBM: https://www.ibm.com/topics/cybersecurity),  </p>
